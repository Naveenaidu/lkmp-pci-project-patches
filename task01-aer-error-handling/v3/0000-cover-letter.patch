Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] Fix long standing AER Error Handling Issues
To: helgaas@kernel.org

This patch series aims at fixing some of the AER error handling issues
we have.

Currently we have the following issues:
 - Confusing message in aer_print_error()
 - aer_err_info not being initialized completely in DPC path before 
   we print the AER logs
 - A bug [1] in clearing of AER registers in the native AER path

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20151229155822.GA17321@localhost/

The patch series fixes the above things. But at the same time, the
primary aim of this patch series is to converge the APEI path and the
native AER error handling paths. In our current code, we find that we
have two different behaviours (especially when it comes to clearing of
the AER registers) for the same functionality.

This patch series, tries to bring the same semantics and hence more 
commonanlity between the APEI part of code and the native OS 
handling of AER errors.

PATCH 1: 
  - Fixes the first issue
  - This patch is independent of other patches and can be applied
    seperately

PATCH 2 - 4:
  - Fixes the second issue
  - Patch 3 is depended on Patch 2 in the series

PATCH 5 - 7
  - Deals with converging the various paths and to bring more
    commonality between them

PATCH 8:
  -  Adds extra information in AER error logs.

All the patches have been "compile-tested" only.

Thanks,
Naveen Naidu

Changelog
