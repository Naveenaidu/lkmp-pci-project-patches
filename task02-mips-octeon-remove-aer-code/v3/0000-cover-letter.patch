Subject: [PATCH v3 0/6] MIPS: OCTEON: Remove redundant AER code
To: helgaas@kernel.org

e8635b484f64 ("MIPS: Add Cavium OCTEON PCI support.") added MIPS
specific code to enable PCIe and AER error reporting (*irrespective
of CONFIG_PCIEAER value*) because PCI core didn't do that at the time.

But currently, the PCI core clears and enables the AER status registers.
So it's redundant for octeon code to do so. This patch series removes
the redundant code from the pci-octeon.c

Currently, the correctable and uncorrectable AER mask registers are not 
set to their default value when AER service driver is loaded. This
defect is also fixed in the "[PATCH 1/6]" in the series.

Thanks,
Naveen
